"""
This script is meant to be used when setting neovim. Neovim configuration 
is for offline files so this script clones all extension to where they are 
meant to be

If a folder name is different to what is clone such as catppuccin-nvim you
can set a value in the extension_urls dictionary to choose the folder name

NOTE: plenary might need github credentials in which case it's easier to just 
download zip file from github repo
